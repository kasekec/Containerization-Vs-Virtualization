# Containerization Vs Virtualization
For a long time, there has been a buzz about Virtualization but lately a new buzz  has appeared and this new buzz  seems to confuse everyone. So what exactly is containerization and how does is different from Virtualization?

## First, What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously.

Applications running on top of a virtualized machine can appear as if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits below it.
