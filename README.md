# Containerization Vs Virtualization
For a long time, there has been a buzz about Virtualization but lately a new buzz  has appeared and this new buzz  seems to confuse everyone. So what exactly is containerization and how does is different from Virtualization?

## First, What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously.

Applications running on top of a virtualized machine can appear as if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits below it.

### What are the Pros?

* **Reduced Hardware Costs:** Applications no longer need their own server because each virtual machine on the physical server now runs them.
* **Faster Server Provisioning and Deployment:** Server virtualization enables system provisioning and deployment within minutes, allowing you to clone an existing virtual machine without the hours and costs normally spent installing a new physical server.
* **Improved Disaster Recovery:** capability to move a virtual machine from one server to another quickly and safely.
* **Increased Productivity:** Having fewer physical servers means there are less of them to maintain and manage.

### What about the Cons?

* **Extra Costs:** Maybe you have to invest in the virtualization software and possibly additional hardware might be required to make the virtualization possible. This depends on your existing network. Many businesses have sufficient capacity to accommodate the virtualization without requiring much cash. If you have an infrastructure that is more than five years old, you have to consider an initial renewal budget.
* **Software Licensing:** This is becoming less of a problem as more software vendors adapt to the increased adoption of virtualization. However, it is important to check with your vendors to understand how they view software use in a virtualized environment.
* **Learn the new Infrastructure:** Implementing and managing a virtualized environment will require IT staff with expertise in virtualization. On the user side, a typical virtual environment will operate similarly to the non-virtual environment. There are some applications that do not adapt well to the virtualized environment.
